# EC2
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), one of **'Amazon Web Services'** most well-known services, offers the ability to run 
applications on the public cloud. Developers can create instances of virtual machines and easily configure the capacity scaling of 
instances using the EC2 web interface.

# S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service, widely known as **Amazon S3**, is a highly scalable, fast, and durable solution for object-level 
storage of any data type. Unlike the operating systems we are all used to, Amazon S3 does not store files in a file system, instead it 
stores files as objects. Object Storage allows users to upload files, videos, and documents like you were to upload files, videos, 
and documents to popular cloud storage products like Dropbox and Google Drive. This makes Amazon S3 very flexible.

# SECURITY GROUPS
# INBOUND AND OUTBOUND
**Inbound** means incoming traffic coming to your EC2 instances. For that you have to add inbound rule. For web server generally we use 
port 80.
**Outbound** means outgoing traffic from your EC2 instances. To connect internet or any browser you have to add outbound rule.

# SERVERLESS

provision and do not require to manage servers.
   
# LAMBDA
**AWS LAMBDA** is an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. Therefore you don't need to worry about which AWS resources to launch, or how will you manage them. 
AWS Lambda helps you to focus on your core product and business logic instead of managing operating system (OS) access control,
scaling, etc. Instead, you need to put the code on Lambda, and it runs.
Note: You should remember that you will charge for AWS services only when the AWS Lambda code executes, else you don't need to pay 
anything.
