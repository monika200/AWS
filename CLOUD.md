# CLOUD
Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's 
hard drive. In other wordsCloud Computing can be defined as delivering computing power( CPU, RAM, Network Speeds, Storage OS software) 
a service over a network (usually on the internet) rather than physically having the computing resources at the customer location. 
Example: **AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.**

# TYPES OF CLOUD
**Public-** Public clouds are managed by third party which provide cloud services over the internet to public, these services are available
as pay-as-you-go billing mode.

**Private-** A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organisation.Private clouds are 
often used by government agencies,financial institutions etc.

**Hybrid-** Hybrid cloud gives combninig facilities of public cloud and private cloud. For this reason they are also called as 
**hetrogenous cloud**. A major drawback of private cloud is the inability to scale on demand and to efficiently address peak loads. 
Here public clouds are needed.Hence, a hybrid cloud takes advantage of both public and private cloud.

# ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD
1. Cost-Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware an software and setting up and runningon-site datacenters. 
2. Speed- Vast amounts of computing resoues can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just few mouse clicks. 
3. Storage Options-You have the option for public, private or hybrid storage depending on the security needs. 
4. Efficiency-All resouces are managed by the cloud server, users don't have to worry about the underlying cost of infrastructure 
and maintenance.
